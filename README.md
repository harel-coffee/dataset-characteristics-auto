# Generalization in Machine Learning as a Function of Dataset Characteristics #

Scripts to generate all the data and figures used in the paper "Generalization in Machine Learning as a Function of Dataset Characteristics" [[arXiv:2006.15680](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15680)]

## Experiments
1. Dataset breast-w has some missing values, and that crashes everything.

## Future works

1. Perform hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV (or similar).
2. Check if values are missing, use imputation.
3. Sort tasks by number of samples.
