# Generalization in Machine Learning as a Function of Dataset Characteristics #

Scripts to generate all the data and figures used in the paper "Generalization in Machine Learning as a Function of Dataset Characteristics" [[arXiv:2006.15680](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15680)]

## Future works

1. Re-run experiments on the [OpenML-CC18](https://docs.openml.org/benchmark/#list-of-benchmarking-suites) benchmark suite.
2. Perform hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV (or similar).
